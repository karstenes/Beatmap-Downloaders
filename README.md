# Beatmap-Downloaders

Just some python files for automatically downloading osu beatmaps

Autosotarks is for you, r/osugame
(downloads all sotarks beatmaps you don't have)

You need the requests library (```pip install requests```)

Getlatestranked.py is currently a little buggy, but it should work.
(It is supposed to download all the latest ranked beatmaps you don't have)

Once the scripts finish downloading the maps, just open osu! and go to the map listing, the .osz files will get automatically imported.



Sorry for being too lazy to write any proper documentation, this was initially made as a joke. (As can be seen in the title bar of the command line application; no, I'm not 12)
