# Beatmap-Downloaders

Just some python files for automatically downloading osu beatmaps

Autosotarks is for you, r/osugame
(downloads all sotarks beatmaps you don't have)

You need the requests library (```pip install requests```)

Getlatestranked.py is currently a little buggy, but it should work.
(It is supposed to download all the latest ranked beatmaps you don't have)



Sorry foe being too lazy to write any proper documentation, this was initially made as a joke.
